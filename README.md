# ⚠️ No longer maintained!
TrollMods is no longer being maintained due to lack of interest. If you're still interested in a project like TrollMods, check out the more established and actively maintained [Cowabunga](https://github.com/leminlimez/Cowabunga).

# TrollMods
Collection of mods based on the [MacDirtyCow exploit](https://github.com/zhuowei/MacDirtyCowDemo/blob/main/vm_unaligned_copy_switch_race.c). No jailbreak is required for the tweaks and will work as long as the device version is between 15.0 and 16.1.2. Changes do not persist, meaning that a device reboot will revert all changes to stock.

# Why?
You may be wondering, why install this, when I can install the original tweaks from their original creators? While you can do that, it's important to note that regular users are limited to three sideloaded apps. TrollMods collects these tweaks into one app, allowing the user to sideload two other apps of their choice. :)

# Disclaimer
While this tweak should be safe, iOS 14 users have reported not being able to revert changes. If you have the opportunity, use jailbreak tweaks instead of this app, and be prepared to restore your device if you're not happy. The developers shall not be held responsible for any damage you may cause using this app, regardless of iOS version.
 
# TrollMods
All TrollMods have been rewritten to be more user-friendly (in my opinion) and more efficient. This means that the experience may not be the same as the originals, but are definitely still functioning as intended.
